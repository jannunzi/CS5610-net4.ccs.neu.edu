        <h1>NodeJS</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>

            allows executing JavaScript on a desktop. With it's

            <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/" target="_blank">extensive library</a>

            of really useful scripts, nodejs is quickly becoming great platform for developing
            very powerful server applications.

            Read more about nodejs from it's main site at

        <h2>Download and Install NodeJS</h2>
        <p>
            NodeJS can be

            <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/" target="_blank">
                downloaded and installed in most operating systems
            </a>.
            
            The installation installs several executables in your local hard drive.
            In Windows environments, it might be in C:\Program Files (x86)\nodejs.
            The two executables we care about are node and npm. Add the directory
            to your path so that you can execute these from anywhere in the command line.
        </p>
        <h2>Hello World NodeJS</h2>
        <p>
            To create a NodeJS program, simple create a JavaScript file with
            valid JavaScript code. The only limitation of the JavaScript code is that
            it is not running in a browser, it's running in your desktop.
            Which is not a limitation at all. Since it's running on your desktop, you
            can do all sorts of things you could not do before. You can access the
            file system, you can connect to databases, you can do network connections
            that would be allowed from a browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's create a Hello World program. In some directory, create a file called
            hello.js and type the following in the file:

            <pre>
console.log("Hello World!");
</pre>
            Then from the command line, change to the directory where the file is located
            and type the following at the command line to run your program:
            <pre>
> node hello.js
Hello World!
</pre>
            Note that the program wrote to the console. Congrats, you just wrote your first
            NodeJS program.
        </p>
