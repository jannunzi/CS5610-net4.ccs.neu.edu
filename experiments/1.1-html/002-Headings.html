    <h1>HTML Heading Elements</h1>

    <p>
        Use HTML Heading Elements to label your content into logical sections.
        There are six heading elements. The six heading elements, H1 through H6,
        denote section headings. Although the order and occurrence of headings
        is not constrained by the HTML DTD, documents should not skip levels
        (for example, from H1 to H3)
    </p>

    <h2>Only Use One H1 Element</h2>

    <p>
        It is recommended to use one H1 element on any page denoting the top
        level section. Subsections are denoted with elements H1 through H6.
        Generally 
    </p>

    <h2>Only Go Up to H3</h2>

    <p>
        Although there are heading elements H1 through H6, in general only H1
        through H3 are used.
    </p>

    <h2>Use Paragraph Elements to Break Up Text Into Paragraphs</h2>

    <p>
        HTML ignores white spaces such as line breaks, multiple spaces, and tabs.
        They are all rendered as single spaces, so even if you format your text
        with white spaces, the formatting will be lost when rendered in a browser.
        White spaces is useful to make the HTML code readable for editing, but
        it is ignored for rendering. Instead, use HTML layout formatting elements
        such as heading elements and paragraph elements to format the page.
